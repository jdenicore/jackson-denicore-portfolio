            For this project I created the circuit for a simple crystal set radio.
            The radio was based on the diagram shown to the left, from "The Crystal Set" by Thomas B. Greenslade Jr. linked below.
            I was targeting the radio frequency 680kHz, corresponding to an oldies station within listening distance of Pittsburgh.
            To achieve this I had to satisfy the equation f = 1/[2Ï€(LC)^1/2] , where f is the frequency I was targeting, L is the inductance of my inductor, and C is the capacitance of my capacitor.

              <p className="text-md">Once the circuit was complete, I could hear faint music through the earpiece, but it was difficult to tell if it was the station I had been targeting. Tuning the inductor by removing or adding loops lead to static and eventually seemed to switch to another station, even though I still could not tell exactly what was playing.
              Although it was not possible to determine whether or not I had targeted the correct station, I still believe that this project was a success, as I was able to achieve some output with relatively simple materials.</p>
